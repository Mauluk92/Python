## Technologies

* **kivy 2.0.0**
* **threading 3.7**
* **pyttsx3 2.90**
* **functools 0.5**

## Prerequisites

Currently this application only runs on Windows 10, because it uses the voice from this OS.

## Features

Currently Elen has no functionalities. It simply appears and say her name, presenting herself.

## Project Status

In progress. I plan to make her cross-platform and add the functionalities of a normal vocal assistant.

## Source

Elen was inspired by a short-novel i wrote before i started programming. She is the protagonist of a science-fantasy novel, a white-haired girl with un-explainable psychic powers. Thus the white rose as a symbol for Elen.
